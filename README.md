# Keyword-Network-and-Word-Frequency-Analysis
This is a part of my Academic Project in the course Fundamentals of Data Analytics to perform **Keyword Network analysis** and **word frequency analysis**

  1. Populated **Weighted Adjacency matrix** and converted it to Weighted Network
  2. Computed **Node degree** and Node strength
  3. Plotted Average **Node Strength** and degree
  4. Computed word frequencies and plotted using histograms for every year
  5. Used **Zipfâ€™s law** and plotted **log-log plots** of word frequencies to rank each year
  6. Created **Bigram Network Graphs** for each year
